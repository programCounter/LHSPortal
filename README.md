# LHSPortal
A online portal for administration and service checking of my personal home server. I share basic functionality with friends and familly, for example hosting game services. This portal will allow them to reach me about issues with the server and to check the status of the service they are trying to reach.

This portal will also give me full front end control of the server and allow me to make changes and view the status of more functions than the public end.
